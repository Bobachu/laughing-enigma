        Hey there! My name is Robert Church, but I much prefer Bob, it's a lot simpler.
        I have spent my 16 year career so far working as QA in video games, starting as a lowly tester working on
        PC and prototype Xbox games (thats the original) and working my way up to QA manager at a mobile
        games publisher in Germany. And no, the job is not as exciting as it sounds. In Germany I managed and trained
        a team of QA Leads working on various projects with different first and third party development teams.
        I worked on many games through the years, but the most well known are from PopCap games where I worked on
        many version of Plants vs. Zombies and the standalone iOS version of Bejeweled Blitz. Having gone as far as
        I wanted to on that career path I decided it was time to start over and so now I am looking into an exciting
        new career as a Web Developer.

        In my off time I really would just like to sit and play video games all the time, but in the interest of not
        dying young(ish) I make sure I don't do that. I do still play quite a bit of course. I tend towards RPGs with
        a great love of Final Fantasy XIV, though my all time favorite games is Chrono Trigger. When I am not doing
        that I spend time with my wife walking our 11 year old White German Shepherd or going out hiking.
        We are hiking wiht a goal of hiking up to Everest Base Camp within the next 2 years. We also like to spend
        some time travelling and really love New York City, which we hope to live in some day.
